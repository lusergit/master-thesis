\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusion}

We looked at the most common framework to build static analysis tools:
starting from hte \(\imp\) language grammar we defined its concrete
denotational semantics and its small step semantics, proving that
semantic properties are in general not decidable. We then abstracted
the execution of programs with the non-relational collecting semantics
\(\bCnr\): the most general non-relational domain. From there we made
one more abstraction with the interval domain \(\inte\).

We built the abstraction chain in figure, and defined abstract
semantics in an inductive way on such domains, s.t.\ for any two
domains \(\bA, \abstract\bA\) s.t.
\(\bA \galois{\abstr}{\concr} \abstract\bA\) implies that
\(\semi[\bA]{\com}\concr(\abstract\eta) \sqsubseteq
\concr(\semi[\abstract\bA]{\com}\abstract\eta)\), i.e., if two domains
are connected trough a Galois connection, teir abstract semantics are
sound. Our goal was to prove that by only relying on the kleene
iteration method to computer least fixpoints
\begin{equation*}
  \lfp(f) = \bigsqcup\left\{f^n(\bot) \mid n \in \n\right\}
\end{equation*}
it was possible to compute the exact abstract semantics
\(\semi[\bA]{\com}\eta\) for any program \(\com\) and initial state
\(\eta\in\bA\). We proved that such thing is possible with the
interval domain \(\inte\) by \emph{bounding} the domain according to
\(\com\) and \(\eta\) to some restricted domain
\(\binte{k_1}{k_2}\). The original idea was that since in the proof
that allowed us to find such domain bounding we did only talk about
\(\sup\) and \(\inf\) values, it should have been possible to apply
the same technique to the non-relational collecting domain \(\bCnr\),
and therefore also compute the most precise invariant in such domain.
