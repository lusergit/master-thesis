\chapter{Program bounds and analysis termination}\label{chap:axiomatized}

%% Framework, introduzione al linguaggio e alle sue propriet√†, si
%% definisce la semantica e si dimostrano un paio di cose

In this chapter we argue that for the language \(\imp\) the abstract
semantics is computable in finite time without widening for abstract
domains with some properties.  Observe that the exact computation
provides, already for our simple language, a precision which is not
obtainable with (basic) widening and narrowing. In the example in
Code~\ref{code1} if we consider the intervals abstract domain, the
semantics maps \(\var\) and \(\var[y]\) to \(\interval{0}{2}\) and
\(\interval{6}{8}\) respectively, while widening/narrowing to
\(\interval{0}{+\infty}\) and \(\interval{6}{+\infty}\).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Code sample where analysis of
  \(\fix{\com}\) is less precise than \(\com^*\), label=code1,
  language=Imp]
  x:=0;
  y:=0;
  while (x<=5) do
     if (y=0) then
        y=y+1;
     endif;
     if (x==0) then
        x:=y+7;
     endif;
  done;
\end{lstlisting}

Of course, for the collecting semantics this is not the case. Already
computing a finite upper bound for loop invariants when they are
finite is impossible as this would allow to decide termination, as we
have seen in Section~\ref{sec:finiteness}. First let's formalize the
problem we want to solve.

\begin{problem}[Analysis termination]\label{problem1}
  Given a program \(\com\in \imp\) and an abstract domain \(\bA\) with
  \(\eta \in \bA\), decide
  \begin{equation*}
    \semi{\com} \eta =^? \top
  \end{equation*}
\end{problem}

To do so we present a novel technique, based on the idea of
\emph{bounds}. Each program is associated to a bound, an ideal value
above which for each variable we can safely assume that the program
diverges.  First, given a program, we associate the program with a
\emph{lower bound} and an \emph{upper bound}. The rough idea is that,
whenever a variable is within its bound, the behavior of the program
with respect to that variable becomes stable. % We also introduce an
% \emph{increment bound} which captures the largest increment or
% decrement that can affect a variable.
