\chapter{Intervals}

%% Interval semantics and analysis are among the most well known abstract
%% interpretation standard abstract domains. Are generally studied as
%% simple non-relational domains, as intervals are not able to capture
%% the relation between variables occurring in the program

%% The following chapter aims to prove the fact that interval analysis is
%% decidable without a widening operator, i.e., infinite ascending chains
%% can be decided.
