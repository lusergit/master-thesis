\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}
The following chapter aims to provide context, notation and the
important external references for the work that will follow on.  We
start with \secref{sec:recursionth} where we introduce some
notation and the important aspect of recursion theory needed to
understand the following chapters.  Later, in
\secref{sec:ordertheory} we explore order theory and set the
notation that we will use in the rest of the thesis to talk about this
topic. Finally \secref{sec:abstrint} introduces the notation and
concepts we need to properly talk about abstract interpretation in
later chapters.
