structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item In section~\ref{sec:prev} we make an introduction on the toic,
  exploring its importance and significance;
\item in section~\ref{sec:recursionth} we will introduce some notation
  and the important aspect of recursion theory needed to understnd the
  following chapters;
\item finally in section~\ref{sec:ordertheory} we explore order theory
  and set the notation that we will use in the rest of the thesis to
  talk about this topic.
\end{itemize}
