\section{Previous work}
\label{sec:prev}

\cite{Gawlitza2009} was the first work to introduce a method to
compute least solutions in polynomial time. It relies on a
generalization of the Bellman-Ford algorithm from
\cite{bellman1958algo} to find a lest solution for system of equations
with addition and least upper bound. The method is then extended until
the authors build a cubic time algorithm for the class of interval
equations (equations with variables in the interval domain).
