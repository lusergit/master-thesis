\section{Assumptions}

\begin{assumption}[Gödel Numbering]\label{ass:godel}
  There is a fixed Gödel numbering for programs, which means there
  exists an \emph{effective bijection} \(\gamma : \imp \to \n\)
  mapping each program to a natural number.
\end{assumption}

\begin{observation}[denumerability of programs]
  Because of assumption \ref{ass:godel}, the set of programs is
  denumerable
\end{observation}

\begin{assumption}[Data type]\label{ass:data}
  There exists a single data type: \(\n\).
\end{assumption}

The limitation above is not restrictive, different data types can be
encoded and decoded into and out of \(\n\).
