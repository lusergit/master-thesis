\section{Interval domain}\label{sec:intervals}

Interval analysis are among the most well known standard abstract
domains in abstract interpretation. They are generally studied as
simple non-relational domains, as intervals are not able to capture
the relation between variables occurring in the program.  The
following chapter aims at proving that interval analysis is decidable
without a widening operator, i.e., despite the presence of infinite
ascending chains the exact value of the analysis can be computed.
