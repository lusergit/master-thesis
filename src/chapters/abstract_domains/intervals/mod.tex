\section{Intervals domain}
\label{sec:intervals}

Interval analysis are among the most well known abstract
interpretation standard abstract domains. They are generally studied
as simple non-relational domains, as intervals are not able to capture
the relation between variables occurring in the program.  The
following chapter aims to prove the fact that interval analysis is
decidable without a widening operator, i.e., infinite ascending chains
can be decided.
