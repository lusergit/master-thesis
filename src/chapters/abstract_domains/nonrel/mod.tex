\section{Non relational collecting}
\label{sec:nonrelational}

In previous we saw how by using bound we can produce a sound
abstraction in the interval domain that coincides with the abstraction
traditionally made with the use of widening and narrowing operators,
in particular with lemma~\ref{le:inc}. In this chapter we argue that
the same procedure can be used in with a general non-relational
collecting abstraction. We first define what we mean by non relational
collecting abstraction and later see how we can adapt
lemma~\ref{le:inc} to this purpouse and produce a sonud abstraction
without widening and narrowing operators.
