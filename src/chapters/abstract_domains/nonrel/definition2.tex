% \subsection{Definition}\label{sub:nonrel}

We first define \emph{non-relational collecting} analysis the the
\(\imp\) language in a standard way, taking again the best correct
approximation (bca) for the basic expressions in \(\expr\).  Unlike
the Intervals domain, where we needed to define the set of intervals,
the non-relational collecting analysis will rely on \(\poset{\z}\) for
the abstract values of each variable in the variable-wise lifting.
Notice that since we are already in \(\poset{\z}\) we do not need to
abstract and concretize the values of our lattice.  As we already
observed, \(\tuple{\poset{\z}, \subseteq}\) is a complete lattice,
where the notions of \(\cap\) and \(\cup\) are well-known.  The next
building block is the definition of some more operations on intervals,
namely the addition and subtraction of an integer constant:

\begin{definition}[Set addition and subtraction]
  For a nonempty set \(S \in \poset{\z}\) and \(c \in \n\) define
  \(S \pm c \veq \{x \pm c \mid x \in S\}\) (recall
  that \(\pm \infty + c = \pm\infty - c = \pm\infty\)).
\end{definition}
