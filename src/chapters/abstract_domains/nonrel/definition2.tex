% \subsection{Definition}\label{sub:nonrel}

We now introduce the non-relational collecting domain. Conceptually,
this domain associates each variable with a subset of \(\z\). The
processes of abstraction and concretization, from and to the powerset
of environments \(\poset{\env}\), involve environments where
variables take values within their respective mappings in the abstract
domain.

We preliminarly define the sum of a constant to a subset of \(\z\),
the result will be another subset of \(\z\) where all values have been
increased by some \(k\in\z\).
\begin{definition}[Set addition and subtraction]
  For a nonempty set \(S \in \poset{\z}\) and \(c \in \n\) define
  \(S \pm c \veq \{x \pm c \mid x \in S\}\) (recall
  that \(\pm \infty + c = \pm\infty - c = \pm\infty\)).
\end{definition}
