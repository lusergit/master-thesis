\chapter{Abstract domains}\label{ch:abstractdomains}

%% Framework, introduzione al linguaggio e alle sue propriet√†, si
%% definisce la semantica e si dimostrano un paio di cose

In the following chapters we present two domains that we will discuss:
the \emph{interval} domain and the \emph{non-relational} collecting
domain. The two domains are in the class of \emph{non-relational}
domains, meaning that they do not represent the relation between
variables. We are interested in these two domains as the properties
that we will discuss in Chapter~\ref{ch:axiomatized} will apply to
these domains, with some restrictions that we will discuss later. In
\secref{sec:intervals} we will talk about the interval domain, with
its characterization in \secref{sub:intervals} and the domain
properties in \secref{sub:intervalsprop}.  Later, in
\secref{sec:nonrelational} we will talk about the non-relational
collecting abstraction by also showing some properties of the
abstraction in \secref{sub:nonrelprop}.
