\chapter{Abstract domains}

In the following chapters we present two domains that we will discuss:
the \emph{interval} domain and the \emph{non-relational} collecting
domain. The two domains are in the class of \emph{non-relational}
domains, meaning that they do not rapresent the relation between
variables. \todo{Expand} We are interested in these two domains as the
properties that we will discuss in Chapter~\ref{chap:axiomatized} will
apply to these domains, with some restrictions that we will discuss
later.  This chapter's sections are organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item[\S\ref{sec:intervals}] Will talk about the interval domain, with
  its characterization in \S\ref{sub:intervals} and the domain
  properties in \S\ref{sub:intervalsprop}.
\item[\S\ref{sec:nonrelational}] Will talk about the non-relational
  collecting abstraction, firstly introducing the definition of the
  non-relational collecting domain in \S\ref{sub:nonrel} and finally
  by showing some properties of the abstraction in
  \S\ref{sub:nonrelprop}
\end{itemize}
