Your command was ignored.
Type  I <command> <return>  to replace it with another command,
or  <return>  to continue without it.

If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.

The control sequence marked <to be read again> should
not appear between \csname and \endcsname.

you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.
